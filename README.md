# KataShoppingCart

This is an application built for the Keoghs interview process.
To run this application please start up Views/Product/Index.cshtml


Checkout
I built the checkout with the four products as shown on the kata. I then styled it with bootstrap to give a more user friendly interface. I struggled implementing the logic behind the two types of promotions. In my previous kata* I did manage to get a discount working for multiple items being in the basket, for this logic I used an if statement to check the quantity and calculate the discount accordingly. Sadly i was not able to do so here with running low on time.


Checkout Tests
I was able to run two tests to see that the controllers are linked up correctly, in terms of running more tests I didn't know how to approach it. I know that I should probably be testing to see my logic returns expected results but again testing isn't something I have a great deal of experience on. I believe my issue was not knowing how to test but rather what to test.
